# Assignment1-Data-Analytics-revou
I created this page to store the results of my work on assignment data analytics from the RevoU mini course. The mini course that I took was on 7 february untill 18 february 2022.

In the Mini Course Assessment Data Analytics by RevoU is divided into 2, namely SQL and Data Visualization and the second is Python.

The powerpoint assignment1 file contains answers about SQL and data visualization, while the assignment2 file contains answers to the Python challenge.
