I created this page to store the results of my work on assignment data analytics from the RevoU mini course. The mini course that I took was on 7 february untill 18 february 2022.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Mini Course Assessment Data Analytics by RevoU is divided into 2, namely SQL + Data Visualization, and the second is Python.
>>
The powerpoint assignment1 file contains answers about SQL and data visualization, while the assignment2 file contains answers to the Python challenge.
>>
The query1.sql and query2.sql files are SQL code to prepare data to be visualized. Then code_challenge_minicourse.py is the source code used to answer the python code challenge.
