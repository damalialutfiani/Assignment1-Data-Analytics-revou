**Bike sharing** is a short-term bicycle rental program that offers an easy, affordable and eco-friendly way to go on a quick trip without the need to bring your own bicycle. In Silicon Valley, the Bay Area Bike Share program allows you to rent a bike for 30 minutes or more and use that bike to get from place to place on local trips.

The Bay Area Bike Share program was launched in 2013 and is modeled on urban bike sharing programs in European cities. The system currently has 700 bikes at 70 different stations in San Francisco, Palo Alto, Mountain View and San Jose. Since the system was launched, more than 800,000 rides have been taken by Bay Area Bike Share riders. The organization is managed by a company called Motivate, which operates bicycle sharing systems around the world, including systems in New York City, Chicago, and Washington DC. In the spring of 2017, the system launched the Ford GoBike program, a major expansion to more than 7,000 total bikes in the Gulf. This expansion will include the first bike-sharing stations in the East Bay (Oakland and Berkeley) and create a low-cost program to increase bike-sharing access for low-income families.

In October 2016, the system celebrated Who's Woman Month, an attempt to encourage women to ride bicycles. Until the end of this month, you can sign up for 24 hours free to try Bay Area Bike Share.

In this assignment is divided into 2, namely :
1.  SQL + Data Visualization
2.  Python.

The powerpoint assignment1 (**assignment1.ppt**) file contains answers about *SQL and data visualization*, while the assignment2 (**assignment2.ppt**) file contains answers to the *Python challenge*.
> The **query1.sql** and **query2.sql** files are *SQL code to prepare data to be visualized*.
> Then **code_challenge_minicourse.py** is the *source code used to answer the python code challenge*.

-- In this project, we use Google BiqQuery and Google Data Studio for visualization. --
